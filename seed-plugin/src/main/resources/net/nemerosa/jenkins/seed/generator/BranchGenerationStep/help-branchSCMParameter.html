    <p>Check to allow the branch to have a SCM location different than the one computed from the branch name.</p>
    <p>
        On branch creation/update, this will provide a <code>BRANCH_SCM</code> parameter which must be the path
        to the branch (like <code>trunk</code> or <code>branches/xxx</code> for Subversion, or the name of the
        branch for Git).
