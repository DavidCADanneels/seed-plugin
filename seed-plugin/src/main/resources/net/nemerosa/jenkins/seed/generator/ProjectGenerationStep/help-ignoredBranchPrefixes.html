<div>
    <p>
        List of prefixes to be ignored in the branch names. This is mostly applicable for the Subversion case. For
        example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        branches/
    </pre>
    <p>
        Each prefix is on one line, and blank lines or lines starting with a <code>#</code> are ignored.
    </p>
