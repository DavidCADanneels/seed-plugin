    <p>
        This section allows you to define an arbitrary snippet of
        <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin">Job DSL</a> code
        executed when a branch pipeline is generated.
    </p>
    <p>
        This can be used to perform additional actions when generating/updating a pipelne.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: most of the time, adding the same DSL in the <code>seed.groovy</code> or
        in the pipeline library will have the same effect.
