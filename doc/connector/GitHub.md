If configured, the plug-in exposes a [hook for GitHub](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) events.

The GitHub hook is disabled by default and can be activated either at global level or at project level.

The GitHub is optionally protected by a token. This token must be configured in the plug-in, either at global level or project level. The same token must be entered in the [GitHub configuration of the web hook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/).
